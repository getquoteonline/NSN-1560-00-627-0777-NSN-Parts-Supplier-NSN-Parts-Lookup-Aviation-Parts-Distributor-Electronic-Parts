## ðŸ›¡ Overview

- **NSN / NIIN**: 1560â€‘00â€‘627â€‘0777  
- **FSC (Federal Supply Class)**: 1560 â€“ Airframe Structural Components  
- **Item Name**: Support, Structural Component, Aircraft  
- **Purpose**: A load-bearing bracket or structural fixture designed to provide reinforcement and support within aircraft assemblies.

---

## 1. Item Description

This NSN refers to a support bracket typically used to mount or reinforce aircraft structures. Based on the nomenclature:

- Provides mounting points for subsystems comprising hydraulic, electrical, or avionics components  
- Interfaces with primary aircraft structureâ€”fuselage frames, longerons, bulkheads  
- Distributes mechanical loads to maintain structural integrity during flight and ground operations

---

## 2. Technical Characteristics

While explicit specs aren't public, typical characteristics include:

- **Material**: High-strength aluminum alloy (2024 or 7075 series) or possibly steel  
- **Manufacturing**: Custom bend or CNC-machined bracket with drilled/tapped holes  
- **Corrosion Defense**: MIL-A-8625 anodizing or passivation  
- **Reinforcement**: May feature gussets, ribbing, or formed angles at stress points

---

## 3. Functional Applications

Such supports are critical for:

- Mounting **avionics racks**  
- Securing **hydraulic tubing or fluid reservoirs**  
- Supporting **cabin or cockpit interior panels**  
- Reinforcing **landing gear fairings** or aerodynamic ducts

Their design ensures alignment and stability under vibration, pressure changes, and operational loads.

---

## 4. Material & Standards

Brackets under this NSN typically comply with:

- **Materials**: MIL-T-9046 (2024-T3) or MIL-T-9047 (7075-T6) aluminum  
- **Coating**: MIL-A-8625 anodizing  
- **Quality**: AS9100 / ISO 9001 accreditations mandatory  
- **Production oversight**: NADCAP for critical machining/fabrication operations

---

## 5. Certification & Traceability

Key procurement documents include:

- **Certificate of Conformance** â€“ with materials batch and heat-identifier  
- **Full Drawing Pack** â€“ engineering print referencing NSN 627-0777  
- **Finish Report** â€“ confirming anodizing thickness & adhesion  
- **Supplier Certifications** â€“ AS9100, NADCAP, ITAR compliance as required

---

## 6. Inspection & Maintenance

- **Routine Inspection**:
  - Visual check for cracks, corrosion, deformation  
  - Nondestructive methods (ultrasonic, dye penetrant) if fatigue is suspected  

- **Maintenance Protocol**:
  - Removal during structural overhaul or systems maintenance  
  - Full replacement if damage is detected; no in-place repairs  
  - Post-installation torque verification to ensure clamping integrity

---

## 7. Procurement Strategy

- Available through ATP quote submission portals (e.g., PartsProHub)  
- RFQ should include:
  - Quantities and lead-time expectations  
  - Drawing revision and ERP reference  
  - Quality control clauses (material, process, testing)

- **Lead Time**:
  - Stock items: 2â€“4 weeks  
  - Custom order: 8â€“14 weeks (depending on machining and finishing)

---

## 8. Storage & Identification

- **Storage Environment**: Dry, temperature-controlled to prevent anodizing degradation  
- **Identification**: Proper marking of serial/heat numbers; secure in labeled bins  
- **Expiration**: Not time-sensitive but requires inspection for oxidation or handling damage every 5 years
